iProtal is a Mac OS X program that scans an iTunes Library of songs and
automatically fetches the correct genre for all the artists.
Currently, it supports:
- Prog Archives (http://progarchives.com)
- Enciclopaedia Metallum (http://metal-archives.com)

At the current state the author is experimenting with the development, but the
program already fetches the genre from the previously listed sources, displaying
some information on the console.

How does it work?
For any selected iTunes song (or the whole iTunes Library), the program retrieves the artist name and tries to retrieve
the genre from the fetchers, one by one. If the first has no results, it tries with the second one and so on.
