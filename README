iProtal is a Mac OS X program that scans an iTunes Library of songs and
automatically fetches the correct genre for all the artists.
Currently, it supports:
- Prog Archives (http://progarchives.com)
- Enciclopaedia Metallum (http://metal-archives.com)

At the current state the author is experimenting with the development, but the
program already fetches the genre from the previously listed sources, displaying
some information on the console.
